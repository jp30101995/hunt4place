                    <h2>Our Story</h2>

                    <p>While on a Himalayan mountaineering camp, we got separated
from the group. We lost our way. There was no way of
contacting the base camp. We were suddenly met by the fear
of man-eaters. We kept walking, trying to find a way out.
After miles of walking down the hill, we found a hutment. We
knocked at the door to meet a huge brown-bearded guy. He
looked enormous and frightening at first. His words,”Youh
boyz outta ‘ere hunting?” was friendly.</p><p>He offered each of us
a drink. Later, he helped us locate our base camps. We found
out on our way back that he was a hunter and knew the entire
jungle. When he left us at the base camp, we offered him
some money. He said, “ever lost ‘ur way, remember this
hunter!”</p><p align="center" style="font-size:16px"><b>We created this digital hunter to help people similarly. People
can hunt 4 places here.</b></p>
